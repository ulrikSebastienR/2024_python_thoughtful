# ARCHIVAL ET SEARCHING NOTES
- write in comments full names, incomplete status and other general instructions for each program to make later searching easier 
- search for a program grep -nr "factorial" for all files in which factorial program was ever tried

# PROGRAMMING NOTES
- For recursion, first write the terminating condition et apres the simple logic
- While loop, can not update the iterator itself, and you need to manually provide ways to iterator the iterator.
