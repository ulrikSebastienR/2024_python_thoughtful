## folder or archive notes


# ARCHIVAL ET SEARCHING NOTES
- write full names for each program in comments to make documentation easier 
- search for a program grep -nr "factorial" for all files in which factorial program was ever tried

# PROGRAMMING NOTES
- For recursion, first write the terminating condition et apres the simple logic
- While loop, can not update the iterator itself, and you need to manually provide ways to iterator the iterator.
