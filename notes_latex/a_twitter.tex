\begin{itemize}
\item What is your routined normal, what is your normal you cant live without
\item Whatever you have practiced the most (or had been repeated to you most) stays with you the longest.  
\item Discipline is a habit like any other, except this time you are consciously building it. Same goes for fighting and giving your best for career and money. Most Indians are pragmatic as this is what they have seen all the time in their families.
\item life is not fair, get used to it, someone is very rich, someone begs for pennies all his life, someone never has a disease, someone's sick genetically, babies die in womb, - NOCES
