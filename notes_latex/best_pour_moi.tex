BEST pour moi twitter

its GET IT DONE, not give it all or godobe or speed or get it done fast or get it done what or  anything else
you will never realise how helpful your instinct or luck can be if you don't chose to get it done
the day you understand how to distinguish meteorites (clutter or debris that comes towards you in your mind) from your gravitational force (what grounds you), you give birth to yourself, free from all the convictions instilled in u by society, stigma or your lack of understanding
